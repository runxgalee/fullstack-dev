description: Analyze codebase for architectural issues, code redundancy, complexity, and structural problems
---

## Task

Use the Task tool to invoke the `development:codebase-analyzer` agent to perform a comprehensive analysis of the current codebase.

The agent will:
- Identify architectural issues and anti-patterns
- Analyze directory structure and file organization
- Detect code redundancy and duplication
- Assess complexity levels and over-engineering
- Find dead code and unused dependencies
- Provide prioritized, actionable recommendations

You should pass a clear prompt to the agent asking it to analyze the codebase and provide a detailed report with findings and recommendations.
