description: Create a new skill with automated testing and validation using the writing-skills agent
---

## Task

Use the Task tool to invoke the `writing-skills` agent to create a new skill with proper testing and validation.

The agent will:
- Create the skill file with proper structure
- Write comprehensive test cases
- Validate the skill syntax and configuration
- Test the skill invocation to ensure it works correctly
- Provide verification steps

Pass the user's skill description and requirements to the agent, asking it to create a testable skill with all necessary validation.
