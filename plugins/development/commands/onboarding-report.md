---

## Task

Use the Task tool to invoke the `development:project-analyzer` agent to generate a comprehensive onboarding report for this project.

The agent will:
- Analyze project structure and directory organization
- Identify database dependencies and schema relationships
- Evaluate architectural patterns and design decisions
- Assess module complexity and code organization
- Delegate detailed analysis to specialized agents as needed
- Produce a comprehensive onboarding report

Pass the following prompt to the agent:

```
Analyze this project and generate a comprehensive onboarding report for a new developer joining the team. Include:
1. Project structure and organization
2. Technology stack and dependencies
3. Architecture patterns and design decisions
4. Database schema and data layer
5. Module complexity assessment
6. Developer onboarding guide with setup instructions
7. Recommendations for areas to focus on
```

After the agent completes, present the findings to the user in a clear, structured format.
