- **Decision Making**: Tasks that require [type of analysis/judgment] before implementation
- **Output Requirements**: When the deliverable needs to be [specific format/quality/completeness level]

**Do NOT invoke** when:
- The task is a simple [single action type] that can be handled directly
- [Other exclusion criteria specific to this agent's scope]
