## Purpose

Provide comprehensive project health analysis covering structural integrity, security posture, performance characteristics, and overall code stability. This skill leverages the codebase-analyzer agent along with specialized sub-agents to deliver a thorough quality assessment.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Audit project health** - Get a complete quality assessment of the codebase
- **Identify structural issues** - Find architectural problems and anti-patterns
- **Security review** - Detect potential vulnerabilities and security concerns
- **Performance analysis** - Identify performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- **Code stability check** - Assess test coverage, error handling, and reliability
- **Pre-release review** - Validate codebase before major releases
- **Technical debt assessment** - Quantify and prioritize technical debt

## Analysis Categories

### 1. Structural Analysis

Evaluate the overall architecture and organization:

#### Directory Structure
- **Consistency** - Naming conventions, folder organization
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between layers
- **Module Boundaries** - Proper encapsulation and dependencies
- **Dead Code** - Unused files, orphaned modules

#### Architecture Patterns
- **Pattern Consistency** - Adherence to chosen patterns (MVC, Clean Architecture, etc.)
- **Dependency Direction** - Proper dependency flow (inner layers don't depend on outer)
- **Circular Dependencies** - Identify and report cycles
- **Coupling Analysis** - Measure inter-module dependencies

#### Code Organization
- **File Size** - Identify overly large files (>500 lines)
- **Function Complexity** - Cyclomatic complexity analysis
- **Naming Conventions** - Consistency in naming
- **Code Duplication** - Detect copy-paste patterns

### 2. Security Analysis

Identify potential security vulnerabilities:

#### OWASP Top 10 Checks
- **Injection Flaws** - SQL, NoSQL, OS command injection patterns
- **Broken Authentication** - Weak auth patterns, hardcoded credentials
- **Sensitive Data Exposure** - Unencrypted secrets, logging PII
- **XML External Entities (XXE)** - Unsafe XML parsing
- **Broken Access Control** - Missing authorization checks
- **Security Misconfiguration** - Debug modes, default configs
- **XSS** - Unsanitized user input in output
- **Insecure Deserialization** - Unsafe object serialization
- **Vulnerable Dependencies** - Known CVEs in dependencies
- **Insufficient Logging** - Missing audit trails

#### Code-Level Security
- **Secret Management** - Hardcoded API keys, passwords
- **Input Validation** - Missing or weak validation
- **Output Encoding** - Proper escaping for context
- **Error Handling** - Information leakage in errors
- **Cryptography** - Weak algorithms, improper usage

### 3. Performance Analysis

Identify performance concerns:

#### Code Efficiency
- **Algorithm Complexity** - O(n²) or worse patterns
- **Memory Leaks** - Unclosed resources, unbounded caches
- **N+1 Queries** - Database query patterns
- **Unnecessary Operations** - Redundant computations

#### Resource Management
- **Connection Pooling** - Database, HTTP connections
- **Caching Strategy** - Missing or ineffective caching
- **Async Operations** - Blocking calls in async contexts
- **Bundle Size** - Large dependencies, unused imports (frontend)

#### Scalability Concerns
- **State Management** - Stateful components that prevent scaling
- **Race Conditions** - Concurrent access patterns
- **Resource Limits** - Hardcoded limits, unbounded growth

### 4. Code Stability

Assess reliability and maintainability:

#### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests** - Coverage percentage, critical path coverage
- **Integration Tests** - API and service integration testing
- **E2E Tests** - User journey coverage
- **Test Quality** - Assertions, edge cases, mocking patterns

#### Error Handling
- **Exception Coverage** - Unhandled exceptions
- **Graceful Degradation** - Fallback mechanisms
- **Recovery Patterns** - Retry logic, circuit breakers
- **Error Reporting** - Proper error classification and logging

#### Code Quality
- **Type Safety** - TypeScript strict mode, type coverage
- **Null Safety** - Null/undefined handling
- **Documentation** - Critical function documentation
- **TODO/FIXME** - Outstanding technical debt markers

## Health Score Calculation

Generate a health score (0-100) based on weighted categories:

| Category | Weight | Metrics |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Structure | 25% | Architecture consistency, code organization, complexity |
| Security | 30% | Vulnerability count, secret exposure, dependency health |
| Performance | 20% | Efficiency patterns, resource management |
| Stability | 25% | Test coverage, error handling, type safety |

### Scoring Rubric

**Structure (25 points)**
- 25: Clean architecture, consistent patterns, low complexity
- 20: Minor inconsistencies, acceptable complexity
- 15: Some architectural issues, moderate complexity
- 10: Significant structural problems
- 5: Major architectural issues, high complexity

**Security (30 points)**
- 30: No vulnerabilities, proper secret management, secure patterns
- 24: Minor security concerns, no critical issues
- 18: Some vulnerabilities, needs attention
- 12: Multiple security issues
- 6: Critical security vulnerabilities

**Performance (20 points)**
- 20: Efficient code, proper resource management
- 16: Minor inefficiencies
- 12: Some performance concerns
- 8: Significant performance issues
- 4: Major performance problems

**Stability (25 points)**
- 25: High test coverage (>80%), comprehensive error handling
- 20: Good coverage (60-80%), adequate error handling
- 15: Moderate coverage (40-60%), basic error handling
- 10: Low coverage (20-40%), minimal error handling
- 5: Very low coverage (<20%), poor error handling
